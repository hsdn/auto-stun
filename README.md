## Lancer Issues

When playing as a Lancer, there is a possibility that the automatic casting of the stun may not work if you are casting the **Wallop** or **Super Leap** skill.

Also, for the correct work of canceling skills when casting a stun, you need to use PvE talyph on the **Stand Fast** skill.
